This was a fun, but challenging final project. Thankfully, I was able to reuse a lot of my previous work from the assignments that came before this, and I struggled most with the carriage return character.
My output kept getting messed up, and I wound up using ascii to identify the character that was causing problems and was able to overcome it without much issue.
